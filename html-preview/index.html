      As you sit down to dinner tonight, take a look at your plate. Go backwards in time, imagining all the steps that it took for your food to get from its origin to your plate. Before the cooking, before the shopping, how was your food transported to the supermarket? How was it packaged in the factory? How was it processed in that factory? Before that, how was it brought to the factory? Where did it come from before that? Was it harvested or slaughtered? Then take a step even further back from there. What resources were used to raise your meat or grow your food? How much water was used to irrigate or feed these products? In the case of animals, how much food was needed to feed them? How much energy was used to keep them warm or to transport them?

          <p><strong>Try, for a second, to estimate the total amounts of water, food and energy that went into producing your food, and how much waste was left behind at each step.</strong><br /><br />
A hundred years ago food was produced locally, and populations were limited by the amount of food that could be produced in a given area. But industrialised agriculture, using modern technologies such as fertilisers, pesticides, nutrients and seed breeding, has greatly expanded the productive capacity of our lands, so much so that for Europeans, famine seems to be a thing of the past. Europeans today eat a lot more and eat more meat - twice as much as we did fifty years ago. We do so because we can, because our methods of production allow us to enjoy an abundance of inexpensive food.<br /><br />
But what are the consequences of these changes in diet and in food production? Is the current use of pesticides and fertilisers, as well as the prevalence of monoculture (growing only one type of crop) sustainable in the long term? As the global population grows and as cities expand, as climate change transforms the land and water, will we still be able to enjoy a cheap supply of food? Can we continue to eat a diet rich in animal products - less efficient both in terms of the resources needed to produce them as well as their environmental costs – or do we need to re-examine the way we eat? Can we still afford to throw away up to 180kg of food* per year as we approach our planet’s limits – or do we need to change the way we think about waste?<br /><br />
<strong>Because your food may cost more than you think.</strong></p>
